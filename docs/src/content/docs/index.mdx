description: Launch JupyterLab with extensions — without touching your project's dependencies.

import { Steps, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Launch JupyterLab with your favorite extensions — without adding them to your project's `pyproject.toml` or `pixi.toml`. Works with both **uv** and **pixi** projects out of the box. jlabx manages extensions separately and injects them at launch time.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install jlabx
```

## Quick start

<Steps>

1. **Launch JupyterLab** with all configured extensions:

   ```bash
   jlabx
   ```

2. **Customize** which extensions are loaded:

   ```bash
   jlabx add jupyterlab-vim
   jlabx add jupyterlab-myst
   jlabx remove jupyterlab-git
   ```

3. **See what's configured**:

   ```bash
   jlabx list
   ```

</Steps>

## What it does

jlabx always includes these **core extensions**:

- `jupyterlab` — JupyterLab itself
- `jupyter-collaboration` — real-time collaboration
- `jupyter-lsp` + `python-lsp-server` — language server support

On top of that, it loads **user extensions** from your config file. The defaults are `jupyterlab-vim`, `jupyterlab-myst`, and `jupyterlab-git` — change them with `jlabx add` and `jlabx remove`.

## Environment detection

jlabx auto-detects how to launch based on files in your working directory:

- **Pixi project** (`pixi.toml` / `pixi.lock`) — delegates to `pixi run jupyter-lab`
- **Python project** (`pyproject.toml`) — uses `uv run --with <extensions> jupyter-lab`
- **Standalone** (no project files) — uses `uvx --from jupyterlab --with <extensions> jupyter-lab`

See [Environments](/jlabx/environments/) for details.

## Notebook mode

Pass a `.ipynb` file to launch a single notebook via [juv](https://github.com/manzt/juv), with your jlabx extensions injected automatically:

```bash
jlabx notebook.ipynb
```

juv handles the notebook's own dependencies (via [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline metadata), while jlabx adds your configured UI extensions on top. No separate juv install needed — it's fetched via `uvx`.

If the notebook has no PEP 723 metadata, jlabx auto-detects imports from the code cells and passes them as ephemeral `--with` args. Use `--init-deps` to persist them:

```bash
jlabx notebook.ipynb --init-deps
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Use `jlabx --no-extras` to skip user extensions and launch with only the core set.
</Aside>

## Why?

You're working in a repo with a `pyproject.toml` or `pixi.toml` — maybe it's a library, a data pipeline, or a research project. You want JupyterLab with vim bindings, collaboration, LSP, and other extensions. But adding `jupyterlab` and all those extras to your project dependencies would bloat things up and create conflicts.

jlabx keeps your project clean by managing JupyterLab extensions in a separate config at `~/.config/jlabx/config.toml`, then injecting them at launch time. It auto-detects whether you're in a **pixi** or **uv** project and does the right thing.
